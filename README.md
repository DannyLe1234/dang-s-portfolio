# dang-s-portfolio

Hi, Welcome to my Github page. I'm Ba Minh Dang, Le and I'm a student at the **University of Toronto**. I'm pursuing a **Bachelor of Commerce: Commerce Specialist and Applied Statistic Major**.

ðŸŽ¯ About This Portfolio

This GitHub portfolio showcases a curated collection of data analysis and business analytics projects Iâ€™ve completed. Each repository demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, apply statistical and machine learning techniques, and communicate insights through clean, reproducible code.

My goal is to highlight the technical skills and analytical thinking required for roles in Data Analysis and Business Intelligenceâ€”including proficiency in R, Python, SQL, statistical modeling, and data visualization.

Here is the list of completed projects:

# [Project 1: Predicting Energy Demand in MISO and PJM market](https://dannyle1234.github.io/Predicting-Energy-Demand)

## This is a final capstone group based project that I made for the course MGT301 at the University of Toronto. The objective was to build a predictive machine learning model that can predict energy demand and explore useful business insights.
